Alloy Mods

Oh what's this? a new package? :-)
Starting with Alloy 3.1, we're adding a section of the framework called AlloyMods. What's contained within are a collection of beta shaders, experiments, and one-off's we've done for personal work. 

They are NOT officially supported, not documented (though I'll probably show them off in a vid from time to time). HOWEVER, if you play around with them, and find them truly useful, do feel free to let me know on twitter (@AntonHand), and if enough folk dig a specific shader, we'll consider adding it into the core.

Version 3.1:
- Weathered Blend (an experiment in attenuating a type of 2mat blend with further mesh data)
- WetMask Set (used in the Remnants demo for combining Weighted blend with scrollable wet sections)

Hi Hi,

Super important note. This release is for Unity 5.2 and up ONLY.

Secondly, you MUST perform a directory blowout of Alloy before installing this version, as a bunch of header structure has changed.

1. Open a BLANK new scene.

2. Select the 'Scripts' and 'Shaders' Directories inside the Alloy directory

3. Delete them

4. Import Alloy 3_2_7_ShadersAndEditorCore.unitypackage

Enjoy
